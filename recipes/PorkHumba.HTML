        <h3>Steps: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a hot cooking pot, toss in your pork belly and let it cook until it browns.</li>
                <li>Add in the onion and garlic slices you have and cook, until your onions soften.</li>
                <li>Then, add in your 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, peppercorn, and bay leaves</li>
                <li>Next, pour in 1 cup of pineapple juice and bring your humba to a boil. </li>
                <li>Cover the pan and let your dish simmer until your pork becomes tender. </li>
                <li>If you feel like it’s getting a little too dry for your taste, feel free to add water in as well. This should take about 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>When that time has passed, add in 2 tablespoons of vinegar and wait for your mixture to re-boil.</li>
                <li>Let your dish simmer for about 3 minutes, then spoon in the salted black beans.</li>
                <li>Add in your brown sugar as well, then give your humba 5 minutes more</li>   
                <li>Lastly, take your dried banana blossoms and toss them into the pot.</li> 
                <li>Cook all of your humba ingredients together for the last 5 to 8 minutes.</li>         
            </ol>
