    <img src="PorkBistek.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="Pork Humba" />
    <h2>This pork bistek recipe is a variation of the popular bistek tagalog which is made from thin slices of beef marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, calamansi juice (or lemon/lime juice) and spices. Then braised and simmered until tender. The pork version has almost the same ingredients and procedure on cooking the dish. Just shorter time in cooking because pork tenderloin requires less time to tenderize compared to beef. Actually the word bistek came from the Spanish word bistec which means “steak”. This recipe is by Panlasang Pinoy. </h2>
